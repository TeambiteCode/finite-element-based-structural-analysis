# Finite Element Based Structural Analysis

This is an attempt to implement a CLI tool for

R.M.C.M. Rajapakse, K.K. Wijesundara, R. Nascimbene, C.S. Bandara, R. Dissanayake, **Accounting axial-moment-shear interaction for force-based fiber modeling of RC frames, Engineering Structures**, Volume 184, 2019, Pages 15-36,ISSN 0141-0296,

People: [Gihan Jayatilaka](https://gihan.me), [Suren Sritharan](https://github.com/suren3141) and [Harshana Weligampola](https://github.com/harshana95)

Advised by: [Dr. Kushan Wijesundara](http://eng.pdn.ac.lk/civil/people/drKKWijesundara.php) and [Dr. Janaka Alawathugoda](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/academic-staff/janaka-alawatugoda/)

This work was done as a partial requirement for [CO328 Software Engineering](http://www.ce.pdn.ac.lk/undergraduate-courses/)) course. **This implementation consists of the linear elastic region analysis only.**


This work will be continued by at [https://github.com/pubuduudara/finite-element-based-structural-non-linear-analysis/](https://github.com/pubuduudara/finite-element-based-structural-non-linear-analysis/). Please contact [pubuduudara7@gmail.com](pubuduudara7@gmail.com) if the repository is private. Their work **might** have backward compatibility for input format but they will **not** be using the code from this project.
